# Python--Fundamentals
This is me learning about basic functions, operations  and syntax in Python.

It contains 
Python syntax- to learn the format of Python 
Types and type conversion 
Indexing, concatanating and arithmetic 
Basic functions like len()

I am making sure i have a good basis of Python to get into a robust Dta science career.
